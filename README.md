For tutorialisation or demonstration purposes, *Inputify* will display your keyboard/mouse inputs on screen. Use Inputify with video recording or streaming so watchers know what keyboard shortcuts you're using! 

## Usage 

After launch, Inputify is immediately operational. Start typing and see the results! 
By default, mouse input is not displayed. See Options below to enable it. 
When finished, right-click on the system tray icon <img> to close Inputify. 

### Settings
Right-click on the Inputify system tray icon to access its Options. Hover on any option for more information. 

## FAQ
- The popup is too dark, is there a lighter color? 
  - Disable the Dark Mode in Options.
- Animation is choppy, what's wrong?
  - Inputify is limited to 30 frames per second for low CPU use.
